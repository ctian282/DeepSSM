# DeepSSM: Neural Network based emulator for GW spectrum from cosmological FOPTs

A cosmological emulator for the GW spectrum from the modified sound-shell model.

The sound-shell model: [1909.10040](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10040).

The modified sound-shell model: [2308.12943](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12943).

## Installation
The emulator is built on [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax). Use `conda`, `mamba` or `pip` to install the envrionment in `requirement.txt`. Users are responsible for independently installing the appropriate CUDA version of the related packages.
